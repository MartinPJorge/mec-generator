\usage{
intensityFactors(squareSide = 1, squareCells = 12,
  intenMatrix = NULL, lonAxis = NULL, latAxis = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{squareSide}{side of a region square in kilometers}

\item{squareCells}{number of cell antennas within a region square}

\item{intenMatrix}{intensity matrix returned by baseIntensity()}

\item{lonAxis}{longitude axis returned by baseIntensity()}

\item{latAxis}{latitude axis returned by baseIntensity()}
}
\value{
data.frame with region square longitude and latitude limits,
if they are small squares, their intensity factor, number of side squares,
and average number of cells that are generated, i.e.,
data.frame(lonL, lonR, latB, latT, smaller, factor, sideSquares, avgCells)
}
\description{
Based on the calculus of baseIntensity(), it determines which
factor must multiply each square within the treated region to generate the
specified average number of cell antennas.
